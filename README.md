## Introduction

This project is an example of dashboard in Excel that uses the benefits of power query, excel and VBA. 
All together offers to the user the beauty of the latest data excel data visualizations, the fastness of VBA and the 
scheduled synchronization of power query.


- **Microsoft Excel**

  > Intuitive, ready to use and the most extended program for data manipulation around the word.

- **PowerQuery**
  >  Microsoftâ€™s Data Connectivity and Data Preparation technology that lets you seamlessly access data stored in 
hundreds of sources and reshape it to fit your needs. SQL, NoSQL, local/remote storaged .csv, xlsx, .txt, .xml, .json, .pdf, etc.

- **Visual Basic for Applications**
  > The language under the hood for the most known Microsoft applications. It is the language on which the rest of the 
application is based.


## Software
This Project:
- Should work fine in any Microsoft Excel version from 2011 onwards.
- Mac users may expect some different behaviours related to Microsoft ActiveX forms. These forms are included to 
visualize filtered data in the dashboard panel. As a result table view in mac might not be available in this version.

## Disclaimer
This code is just an example of the capabilities of Excel, and because of that the editability is blocked along with the 
VBA and Powe Query code. If you are interested in a complete version of the dashboard or a customized Excel dashboard,
